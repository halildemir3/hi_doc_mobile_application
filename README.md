<br/> <br/> 
“Hi_doc” is an application coded in Flutter, designed for doctors to find medication,<br/> 
ambulances, and make doctor appointments. The interface is meticulously developed with <br/> 
clean and professional code. The directory structure includes a folder named “constants/”<br/> 
which contains important files.<br/>

<br/> <br/> 

Inside this folder, you can find the “colors.dart” file, where colors are stored as HEX codes,<br/> 
and there is a “colorX” method that converts the HEX code into Flutter color code. You can manage<br/> 
the colors from this file.<br/> 

Another file in the “constants/” folder is “path.dart”, which stores the links and paths used<br/> 
in the application. All file paths under the “assets” folder are defined in this file. Additionally,<br/> 
all icons used in the application are in the SVG format and their paths are defined in this file.<br/> 

In the “styles.dart” file, the styling process is performed. All styles such as text styles and padding <br/> 
are defined as variables in this file.<br/> 

The widget files representing the screens are located in the “views” folder, while some custom components<br/> 
are under the “widgets” folder.<br/> 

The application does not use a state management solution, so you are free to use the desired method. <br/> 
For route management, a simple implementation with getX is used, but you should create your own route <br/> 
and state management system.<br/> <br/>
